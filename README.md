# CROSSWORLD LEAGUE — Simple Landing Page

Files included:
- index.html — single-page HTML with your provided content
- styles.css — lightweight CSS for layout and styling

What I added
- A responsive, accessible single-page layout (banner, about, staff roles, player & team roles, contact).
- The staff roles block is preserved exactly as you wrote it (spacing/format kept).
- Contact emojis and wording are left untouched as you provided.

How to use
1. Edit index.html to replace placeholders:
   - Replace "Your server" with your Discord server name or invite link.
   - Replace the footer "Site by idk1234lolbro-netizen" if you want different attribution.
2. Host it:
   - Quick option: Push to a GitHub repository and enable GitHub Pages (Settings  Pages).
   - Alternatives: Netlify, Vercel, or any static-hosting provider.

Next steps I can help with
- Create a logo SVG or PNG and add it to the header.
- Convert this into a small React/Vue app or a template with multiple pages.
- Add a contact form (with Netlify Forms or a simple server endpoint).
- Add placeholders / components for team registration and player roles for when Soccer Zero releases.

Tell me which of the next steps you'd like and I’ll create it.
